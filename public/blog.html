                         I often look back at this site, and I realize that we never did update it with the final results of the Dyl and Joe Journey.<br><br>

                         So here goes. <br><br>

                         For a week, Dylan and I lived in a hostel on Mason street, rented bikes, and went door to door to as many tech companies as we could possibly could.
                         Often, we thought we wouldn't make it in, and often we were wrong - as we were welcomed with open arms and dried mangos.
                         Sometimes, all we had to do was knock. Other times we had to make up appointments with a "John S." (a likely enough name), and apologize later. <br><br>

                         Here we are, two Canadian kids, thousands of miles from our home, knocking on these doors of companies we've idolized from an internet away, with shaking hands and a nervous/excited smile.
                         What we found inside we could never have imagined. We found that people loved our sense of adventure, they loved our willingness to step out of the box
                         and to show our humanity, our creativity, our resourcefulness. <br><br>

                         After about a week of biking up the hills of SF, meeting a bunch of companies (we marked them as red on the map), and seeing the inside of the tech world, we flew home. We had a few connections,
                          and we spent the last few months of our school year doing just enough work to pass, quitting our jobs, and focusing all our efforts on following up and doing interviews. <br><br>

                         I hit it off with a startup called Mavenlink. After a few over the phone interviews and a close call with the visa - which involved a heartfelt email plea to the CEO, I had a year long internship. Dylan took the long way around, initially working with IBM, a small startup in Waterloo, and eventually working with Google in Mountainview. <br><br>

                         We'd take the Cal-Train and walk the streets of SF, thinking about how impossible it seemed that we'd ever be back.<br><br>

                         During that year, we experienced more freedom than we ever had before. Living on our own, working professionally, and being far away from where we started. The whole year, Ghost on The Shore, with it's lyrics "I'm going away for a long time!", played in my head, as we picked a goal that seemed so far out of our reach, and accomplished it.<br><br>

                         After a year of being away, Dylan and I are back in school, finishing up our engineering degrees. We'll graduate in a few months, and after that who knows where we'll end up.<br><br>

                         I might be in <a href="http://www.joegaebel.com">Australia</a>, and Dyl might be building a <a href="http://www.kingofthestack.com">startup</a>,<br>
                         but I think both of us will always remember the Dyl and Joe Journey.
